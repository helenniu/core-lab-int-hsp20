			Design Principles
		</h2>

		<section>
		<h3>
			Pair simplicity with delight
		</h3>
		<p>
			Design purposeful interfaces that favor usability, while also infusing delight through color, animation and language.
			
		</p>

		<section>
		<h3>
			Human
		</h3>
		<p>
			Be gentle, be human. Interfaces must respond promptly to users in a human way so that the experience feels fast and like a real conversation. Every person is different. Take into account our products are being used by various type of users with different goals and various levels of knowledge.
			
		</p>

	<section>
		<h3>
			Focused
		</h3>
		<p>
			Reduce, remove, reduce copy, keep the information architecture shallow, create limited cause to actions, don’t overcomplicate things in technology, focus on the top tasks, not features that people don’t want, and probably lots of other things, and make our design focused on what it’s about, what the site’s about.

<div class="bodycopy">This is what body copy looks like. Strategic design means designing for a specific objective. More often than not, that objective is growing a business. But it’s important to recognize that there’s a difference between being strategic by being the conduit between the business and the user, and designing for the business alone.</div>
