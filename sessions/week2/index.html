		<p>The early morning sky above Atlanta is still black, but a team of recycling inspectors is up and moving along Nacoochee Drive ruthlessly assessing the discarding habits of the residents.</p>

<p>The team gingerly tips one of the 96-gallon blue recycling pails placed curbside and eyeballs its contents. There’s folded cardboard, a few aluminum soda cans, and several empty milk jugs, but also a plastic bread bag and a ripped-open packet for mozzarella sticks. The team makes an instant call: reject.</p>

<p>Eschewing the hard-hitting bullet points, pithy slogans, and data graphics of many slide decks, Eliasson’s presentation, like his art, was a masterclass in eliciting an audience’s awe and curiosity.</p>

<p> The team tags the trash prominently with an OOPS label reminiscent of a hotel “do not disturb” sign. It has two purposes. The first is to lightheartedly explain to the owners what they’ve done wrong. The tag includes illustrations of most common forbidden categories, such as plastic bags. The second is to tell the recycling trucks not to pick up. Residents either fix the problem or forgo service. 
</p>

<p> “Zero tolerance brings the quickest compliance,” says Cecilia Shutters, the technical adviser for Feet on the Street, the program Atlanta is using to corral its residents into better recycling behavior. </p>

		<p>Deliberately rejecting recycling might sound like a rough tactic, but for city recycling programs these are desperate times. For about two decades, the U.S. and most of the world sent much of its dirtiest recycling to China, where cheap labor sorted through the mess extracting valuables and dumping the rest. But in 2017, China severely tightened rules for taking contaminated trash.</p>

<p>The fallout has been dramatic. Five years ago, China took 40% of America’s recyclables, according to the National Waste and Recycling Association, a Washington, D.C. area-based industry advocacy group. Now almost none of it goes to China.
</p>

<p>As the secondary market collapsed, the price of municipal recycling programs soared. In response, dozens of U.S. towns, such as Franklin, N.H. and Broadway, Va., simply shuttered their programs and sent everything to the landfill.</p>

<p>But a growing number of American cities and towns are trying another option: cleaning up their waste stream. To accomplish that, they’re forcing American households do some of the thankless job of trash sorting that previously fell to Chinese workers. The cities that figure out how to get their citizens to comply have a better shot at making money in the secondary market that remains—or even better, creating a more robust recycling market here at home.</p>

		Americans don’t think much about their trash once it’s picked up. Much of what is collected as recyclables at curbside is contaminated byproducts, including plastic bags and other thin plastic film that has no hope of a second life. Roughly one-fourth of all recyclables is so contaminated it goes directly into the garbage after collection, according to the National Waste and Recycling Association.
	</p>

	<p>
		The problem has been exacerbated in recent years by cities adopting “single stream,” a method by which all recyclable waste from bottles, cans, cardboard and plastics is collected in one basket. Using a single bin as a catchall is correlated with higher contamination rates, but it’s far more convenient and cost-effective for collectors. That’s why the method grew in the U.S. from 29% of recycling in 2005 to 80% by 2014, according to a survey by the American Forest and Paper Association.
	</p>

	<p>
		In some ways, Feet on the Street, which is about having Americans face the contamination, makes particular sense for Atlanta, which is home to Coca-Cola Co. Beverage groups in America have a long, documented history of promoting recycling and anti-litter campaigns that push the responsibility for waste away from industry and back onto the consumer.

	</p>

	

	


	
	<p>
		When China started sending out warning that it would eventually restrict waste intake way back in 2013, the Partnership saw its opening. In 2014 it began testing a program that educated citizens on what materials had value to recyclers.
		
	</p>
	<p>
		Early efforts with governments in Massachusetts and Ohio tested combinations of sticks and carrots to maximize participation without causing alienation. In the end, says Cody Marshall, chief community strategy officer with the Partnership, what worked best was sending a mailing that educated residents on the rules, then following up by enforcing those rules uncompromisingly. This included putting a team of inspectors out to evaluate each recycling can.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Just giving warnings but still collecting the material doesn’t work,” he says, “but when we started rejecting the cart, that’s when the behavior change started clicking.”
	</p>

	

	<p>
		There is near consensus that America’s widespread reliance on single stream recycling has created a mess.
	</p>
	<p>
		“Look, the way we’ve taught people to recycle is horrendous,” says Susan Collins, executive director of the Container Recycling Institute, a California nonprofit group. “No other country does it like this.” In Japan, some towns demand that residents sort trash into 45 separate categories, including separate bins for pillows and toothbrushes. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Furthermore, counting on material recycling facilities to sort through piles of recycling is “like asking people to unscramble an egg,” Collins says. And, she argues, there are more effective ways. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, nine states offer small refunds for returned cans and bottles. In those states, 62% of polyethylene terephthalate (Pet) plastic bottles sold are eventually returned. That’s vs. collection rates of 17% of Pet plastic bottles in the rest of the country, she says. Such laws, she adds, have been historically opposed by the very companies that now fund the Recycling Partnership.
	</p>
	<p>
		Recycling Partnership Chief Executive Officer Keefe Harrison says her group doesn’t oppose container laws and sometimes works in communities that use the policies. “Deposits alone are not enough to run a healthy system,” she says. “Communities still need help with buying new carts, trucks, and community engagement programs like Feet on the Street.”
