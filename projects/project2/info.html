		<h2>Verifying your identity</h2>
		<p>If you do not have a DMV or social security number, you may use a valid photo ID, a current utility bill, bank statement, paycheck, government check or some other government document that shows your name and address. You may include a copy of one of those types of ID when you mail this form. </p>
		<p>We’ll try to check your identity before Election Day, through the DMV number (driver’s license number or non-driver ID number), or the last four digits of your social security number, which you’ll fill in below.</p>
		<p>If we are unable to verify your identity before Election Day, you will be asked for ID when you vote for the first time. </p>
